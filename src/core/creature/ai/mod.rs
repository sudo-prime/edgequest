/// AIs are intended to be used as trait objects. The idea is that creatures are given some boxed
/// AI object to hold. This object is then guaranteed to have a `take_turn()` function, meaning
/// that all creatures have a uniform way of taking a turn without needing to know the exact AI
/// implementation.
/// 
/// This gives us the primary advantage of being able to swap AI objects out at will, and also allow
/// AIs to track data about themselves such as turns spent asleep, turns spent confused, etc. AIs really are just
/// the state deciders for creatures, and thus the implementation of the creature's AI and their actual codified data
/// are separate entities, which is a good thing.
/// 
/// This concept of using trait objects for their unified function is similar to abstract classes in other languages,
/// and directly creates a pseudo ECS system since AI is now simply a component of a creature.

  /// completely considering adding randomized personalities to monsters to create even more combinations of behavior.
